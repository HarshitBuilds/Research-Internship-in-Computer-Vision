# Research Internship in Computer Vision

This repository contains the code developed by my co-interns and me during our Internship period in the summer of 2024 at Divyadrishti Imaging Labratory, IIT Roorkee. 
We worked on the identification and quantification of voids which was found in our material of interest. The dataset consisted of high resolution Computed Tomography (CT) scan images of the equipment.

Our key contributions include: 

  -Developing a GUI(graphical User Interface) for manual hand annotation.
  
  -Creating and training a neural network based on the U-net architecture for the task of image segmentation.
  
  -Curating a data pipeline for preprocessing data and generating ground truth mask required for training the model.
